						<h2>Acerca de Pepe The Frog</h2>
						<p>
							Originally swiped from comic series Boy’s Club by Matt Furie back in 2008, a urinating frog saying “feels good man” was the icon of numerous posts on 4chan. As sad, smug, angry and obese versions of Pepe were created by users, Pepe gradually died away through over-use and the in-joke being adopted by the mainstream, but he’s had a fresh surge in popularity over the past year as he came to epitomize and encompass the concept of memes as a whole. Vast arrays of new designs had him mimicking Bane from Batman or Javert from Les Miserables, while an artful meme might be replied with a drawing of a smartly dressed Pepe raising a glass opf champagne to the poster declaring “well meme’d my friend”. As any new meme now inevitably provokes a Biblical swarm of Pepes, he is the ebola of internet in-gags.s

						<h2>Some real shit</h2>
						<p>
							We may be living in the last days and people need to be aware.
							My only question for you is are you prepared?
							People must make drastic changes even though they're unwilling.
							People must stop stealing, doing and dealing drugs, lying and killing.
							To get to God, we must go through his son.
							Violent people had better put away their guns.
							When Jesus returns, the Earth will be transformed into a paradise and I'm overjoyed.
							But wicked people won't live in the paradise, they will be judged and then destroyed.
							If you're a big sinner, you'd better stop committing your sins.
							God wants everybody to live in paradise but the wicked won't win.
							To live in this paradise, people must love and honor Jesus and God because they are who we need.
							People must start thinking of others instead of just themselves, they must put an end to their greed.
							The end may come next week or it may not arrive for another thousand years.

						<h2>My new dog</h2>
						<p>
							I've got a new dog and she's as pretty as she can be.
							She has light brown fur and her name is Marie.
							She is a very sweet dog and I'm glad that she's so tame.
							She is special, that's why I gave her my mom's middle name.
							She is mixed, she's part pit bull and part hound.
							Before her I only had a fish and he died.
							My parents brought her in last week.
							She was abandoned in the streets but we saved her.
							I like to hug her and play with her.
							My friend Jerry also has a dog and he's teaching me how to train her.
							On the evenings we go for a walk around the corner.
							Yesterday I bought her a new collar with her name written on it, it's pink with white.	
							She is beautiful and I'm glad to have her around.
							I love to go out and play ball with her, she's such a runner!
							I am glad that she's comfortable with her new home.
							I love my new dog and she loves me.
							I am very lucky to own Marie.
							And I hope to stay with her forever.
